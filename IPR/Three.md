## Copyright time
The duration of copyright, as well as when the copyright term begins, is determined by the law in the country where the copyright is registered or recognized. Under the Berne Convention, to which most countries are signatories, the copyright protection is automatically in force upon the creation of the work without the need for formal registration.

Here's how it generally works:

### In India:

Under the Copyright Act, 1957, the duration of copyright begins from the date the work is created. However, the term of protection is calculated differently depending on the type of work:

1. **For Literary, Dramatic, Musical, and Artistic Works:** The term of copyright protection is the lifetime of the author plus 60 years after their death. For works of joint authorship, the 60 years are calculated from the death of the last surviving author.

2. **For Anonymous and Pseudonymous Works:** Copyright lasts for 60 years from the date of publication, provided the identity of the author does not become known during this period.

3. **For Cinematograph Films, Sound Recordings, Photographs, Posthumous Works, Government Works, Works of International Organizations:** Copyright lasts for 60 years from the date of publication.

4. **For Computer Software:** It is treated as a literary work and is also protected for the lifetime of the author plus 60 years after their death.

### Internationally:

For countries that adhere to the Berne Convention, the minimum term of protection offered by the convention is the life of the author plus 50 years after their death. However, many countries, including those in the European Union and the United States, have extended the term beyond this minimum requirement.

### Copyright Term Commencement:

- **Creation of the Work:** The copyright term comes into force from the moment a work is created and fixed in a tangible form that is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.
- **Publication:** While the creation of the work starts the copyright term, publication can affect the duration of copyright for certain types of works, especially if the author is unknown.

In summary, the duration of copyright protection generally commences upon the creation and fixation of the work, and the length of protection depends on the type of work and the laws of the country where copyright protection is sought.

## Copyright 1976

The Copyright Act of 1976, a fundamental legal framework in the United States, grants copyright holders exclusive rights over their copyrighted works. The Act represents a significant overhaul of the U.S. copyright system and harmonizes it more closely with international standards set by the Berne Convention. Here are the key rights granted to copyright owners under this act:

### 1. Right to Reproduce the Work
- **Description:** The copyright owner has the exclusive right to make copies of the copyrighted work.
- **Application:** This includes duplicating the work in any form, such as printed publications, digital copies, recordings, or films.

### 2. Right to Prepare Derivative Works
- **Description:** This right allows the copyright owner to create new works based on the original copyrighted work.
- **Application:** Examples include translations, movie adaptations from books, remixes of songs, or any other form in which the original work may be transformed or adapted.

### 3. Right to Distribute Copies
- **Description:** Copyright owners have the exclusive right to sell, rent, lease, or lend copies of their works.
- **Application:** This covers the distribution of physical and digital copies of the work.

### 4. Right to Publicly Perform the Work
- **Description:** The right to perform the work publicly.
- **Application:** This is particularly relevant for plays, music performances, and films. Public performance could be live or through playing of recordings.

### 5. Right to Publicly Display the Work
- **Description:** The copyright owner has the right to display the work publicly.
- **Application:** This applies to paintings, photographs, sculptures, and software. It covers both direct display and projection or screen display.

### 6. Right to Perform Sound Recordings Publicly through Digital Audio Transmission
- **Description:** This right, added to address the digital age, covers the public performance of sound recordings via digital audio means.
- **Application:** It's most commonly applied to the streaming of music on the internet.

### Limitations and Exceptions
- **Fair Use:** The Act includes the concept of fair use, which allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes like commentary, criticism, education, news reporting, and research.
- **First Sale Doctrine:** Once a copy of a work is lawfully sold, the copyright owner's right to control the distribution of that copy is exhausted.
- **Educational and Library Exceptions:** There are specific provisions that allow limited uses in educational settings and libraries.

The Copyright Act of 1976 thus provides comprehensive protection to creators and copyright owners, ensuring they can control and benefit from their creations while balancing public interests with exceptions like fair use.


## Patent Opposition 
The Indian Patents Act of 1970 allows for two types of patent oppositions: pre-grant and post-grant. In the pre-grant opposition, anyone can challenge a patent application after its publication but before its grant, by writing to the controller. The controller then decides based on the evidence and submissions, and may grant, refuse, or require amendments to the patent. Post-grant opposition, on the other hand, is available within one year of the patent's grant publication. It's initiated by an 'interested person', such as someone involved in similar research or business. This opposition is reviewed by a three-member Opposition Board, and the controller makes a decision based on their report and hearings. Dissatisfied parties can appeal to the Appellate Board.
